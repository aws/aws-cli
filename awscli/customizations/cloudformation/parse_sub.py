"""
This module parses CloudFormation Sub strings.

For example:

    !Sub abc-${AWS::Region}-def-${Foo}

The string is broken down into "words" that are one of four types:

    String: A literal string component
    Ref: A reference to another resource or paramter like ${Foo}
    AWS: An AWS pseudo-parameter like ${AWS::Region}
    GetAtt: A reference to an attribute like ${Foo.Bar}
