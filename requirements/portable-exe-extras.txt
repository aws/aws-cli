pyinstaller==6.11.1
# pyinstaller takes a dependency on importlib_metadata,
# conditional on the Python version. This generates lockfiles
# that fail to install on some Python versions supported by v2.
# To avoid managing an additional dimension of lockfiles based on
# Python versions, we take an explicit dependency on importlib_metadata.
importlib_metadata>=7.0,<=7.1.0
