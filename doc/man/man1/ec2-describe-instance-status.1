.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes the status of an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.
Instance status provides information about two types of scheduled events for an
instance that may require your attention:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Scheduled Reboot: When Amazon EC2 determines that an instance must be
rebooted, the instance\(aqs status will return one of two event codes:
\fBsystem\-reboot\fP or \fBinstance\-reboot\fP . System reboot commonly occurs if
certain maintenance or upgrade operations require a reboot of the underlying
host that supports an instance. Instance reboot commonly occurs if the
instance must be rebooted, rather than the underlying host. Rebooting events
include a scheduled start and end time.
.IP \(bu 2
Scheduled Retirement: When Amazon EC2 determines that an instance must be shut
down, the instance\(aqs status will return an event code called
\fBinstance\-retirement\fP . Retirement commonly occurs when the underlying host
is degraded and must be replaced. Retirement events include a scheduled start
and end time. You\(aqre also notified by email if one of your instances is set to
retiring. The email message indicates when your instance will be permanently
retired.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If your instance is permanently retired, it will not be restarted. You can avoid
retirement by manually restarting your instance when its event code is
\fBinstance\-retirement\fP . This ensures that your instance is started on a
healthy host.
.sp
\fBdescribe\-instance\-status\fP returns information only for instances in the
running state.
.sp
You can filter the results to return information only about instances that match
criteria you specify. For example, you could get information about instances in
a specific Availability Zone. You can specify multiple values for a filter
(e.g., more than one Availability Zone). An instance must match at least one of
the specified values for it to be included in the results.
.sp
You can specify multiple filters. An instance must match all the filters for it
to be included in the results. If there\(aqs no match, no special message is
returned; the response is simply empty.
.sp
You can use wildcards with the filter values: \fB*\fP matches zero or more
characters, and \fB?\fP matches exactly one character. You can escape special
characters using a backslash before the character. For example, a value of
\fB\e*amazon\e?\e\e\fP searches for the literal string \fB*amazon?\e\fP .
.sp
The following filters are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBavailability\-zone\fP \- Filter on an instance\(aqs availability zone.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBinstance\-state\-name\fP \- Filter on the intended state of the instance, e.g.,
running.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBinstance\-state\-code\fP \- Filter on the intended state code of the instance,
e.g., 16.

.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-results\fP  (integer)The maximum number of paginated instance items per
response.
.sp
\fB\-\-next\-token\fP  (string)A string specifying the next paginated set of results
to return.
.sp
\fB\-\-include\-all\-instances\fP  (boolean)
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-filters\fP  (list)The list of filters to limit returned results.
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B (structure)
A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple values can be
specified per filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified values
for it to be returned from an operation.
.sp
Wildcards can be included in filter values; \fB*\fP specifies that zero or
more characters must match, and \fB?\fP specifies that exactly one character
must match. Use a backslash to escape special characters. For example, a
filter value of \fB\e*amazon\e?\e\e\fP specifies the literal string \fB*amazon?\e\fP
.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBvalues\fP  (list of string)
Contains one or more values for the filter.
.TP
.B \fBname\fP  (string)
Specifies the name of the filter.
