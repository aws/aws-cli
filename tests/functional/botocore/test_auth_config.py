# In the future, a service may have a list of credentials requirements where one
# signature may fail and others may succeed. e.g. a service may want to use bearer
# auth but fall back to sigv4 if a token isn't available. There's currently no way to do
# this in botocore, so this test ensures we handle this gracefully when the need arises.

# Some services (such as Bedrock) have customizations that bypass this limitation
# by manually assigning a signer when credentials are unavailable. To avoid
# false positives, we filter these services out of the tests below.
