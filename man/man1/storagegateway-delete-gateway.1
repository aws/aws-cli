.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This operation deletes a gateway. To specify which gateway to delete, use the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request. The operation deletes
the gateway; however, it does not delete the gateway virtual machine (VM) from
your host computer.
.sp
After you delete a gateway, you cannot reactivate it. Completed snapshots of the
gateway volumes are not deleted upon deleting the gateway, however, pending
snapshots will not complete. After you delete a gateway, your next step is to
remove it from your environment.
.IP Warning
You no longer pay software charges after the gateway is deleted; however, your
existing Amazon EBS snapshots persist and you will continue to be billed for
these snapshots. You can choose to remove all remaining Amazon EBS snapshots
by canceling your Amazon EC2 subscription. If you prefer not to cancel your
Amazon EC2 subscription, you can delete your snapshots using the Amazon EC2
console. For more information, see the \fI\%AWS Storage Gateway Detail Page\fP .
