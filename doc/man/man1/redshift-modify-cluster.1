.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Modifies the settings for a cluster. For example, you can add another security
or parameter group, update the preferred maintenance window, or change the
master user password. Resetting a cluster password or modifying the security
groups associated with a cluster do not need a reboot. However, modifying
parameter group requires a reboot for parameters to take effect.
.sp
You can also change node type and the number of nodes to scale up or down the
cluster. When resizing a cluster, you must specify both the number of nodes and
the node type even if one of the parameters does not change. If you specify the
same number of nodes and node type that are already configured for the cluster,
an error is returned.

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cluster\-identifier\fP  (string)
The unique identifier of the cluster to be modified.
.sp
Example: \fBexamplecluster\fP
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-node\-type\fP  (string)
The new node type of the cluster. If you specify a new node type, you must
also specify the number of nodes parameter also.
.sp
When you submit your request to resize a cluster, Amazon Redshift sets access
permissions for the cluster to read\-only. After Amazon Redshift provisions a
new cluster according to your resize requirements, there will be a temporary
outage while the old cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the
new cluster. When the new connection is complete, the original access
permissions for the cluster are restored. You can use the  describe\-resize to
track the progress of the resize request.
.sp
Valid Values: \fBdw.hs1.xlarge\fP | \fBdw.hs1.8xlarge\fP
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cluster\-parameter\-group\-name\fP  (string)
The name of the cluster parameter group to apply to this cluster. This change
is applied only after the cluster is rebooted. To reboot a cluster use
reboot\-cluster .
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting.
.sp
Constraints: The cluster parameter group must be in the same parameter group
family that matches the cluster version.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cluster\-type\fP  (string)
The new cluster type.
.sp
When you submit your cluster resize request, your existing cluster goes into a
read\-only mode. After Amazon Redshift provisions a new cluster based on your
resize requirements, there will be outage for a period while the old cluster
is deleted and your connection is switched to the new cluster. You can use
describe\-resize to track the progress of the resize request.
.sp
Valid Values: 
.nf
\(ga\(ga
.fi
multi\-node | single\-node \(ga\(ga
.TP
.B \fB\-\-master\-user\-password\fP  (string)
The new password for the cluster master user. This change is asynchronously
applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the request and the
completion of the request, the \fB\-\-master\-user\-password\fP element exists in
the \fBPendingModifiedValues\fP element of the operation response.
.. note:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Operations never return the password, so this operation provides a way to
regain access to the master user account for a cluster if the password is
lost.
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting.
.sp
Constraints:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length.
.IP \(bu 2
Must contain at least one uppercase letter.
.IP \(bu 2
Must contain at least one lowercase letter.
.IP \(bu 2
Must contain one number.
.IP \(bu 2
Can be any printable ASCII character (ASCII code 33 to 126) except \(aq (single
quote), " (double quote), , /, @, or space.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vpc\-security\-group\-ids\fP  (list of string)
A list of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security groups to be associated with
the cluster.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-allow\-version\-upgrade\fP  (boolean)
If \fBtrue\fP , upgrades will be applied automatically to the cluster during the
maintenance window.
.sp
Default: \fBfalse\fP
.TP
.B \fB\-\-preferred\-maintenance\-window\fP  (string)
The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur, if
necessary. If system maintenance is necessary during the window, it may result
in an outage.
.sp
This maintenance window change is made immediately. If the new maintenance
window indicates the current time, there must be at least 120 minutes between
the current time and end of the window in order to ensure that pending changes
are applied.
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting.
.sp
Format: ddd:hh24:mi\-ddd:hh24:mi, for example \fBwed:07:30\-wed:08:00\fP .
.sp
Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun
.sp
Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-automated\-snapshot\-retention\-period\fP  (integer)
The number of days that automated snapshots are retained. If the value is 0,
automated snapshots are disabled. Even if automated snapshots are disabled,
you can still create manual snapshots when you want with
create\-cluster\-snapshot .
.sp
If you decrease the automated snapshot retention period from its current
value, existing automated snapshots which fall outside of the new retention
period will be immediately deleted.
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting.
.sp
Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cluster\-security\-groups\fP  (list of string)
A list of cluster security groups to be authorized on this cluster. This
change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
.sp
Security groups currently associated with the cluster and not in the list of
groups to apply, will be revoked from the cluster.
.sp
Constraints:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens
.IP \(bu 2
First character must be a letter
.IP \(bu 2
Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

.TP
.B \fB\-\-number\-of\-nodes\fP  (integer)
The new number of nodes of the cluster. If you specify a new number of nodes,
you must also specify the node type parameter also.
.sp
When you submit your request to resize a cluster, Amazon Redshift sets access
permissions for the cluster to read\-only. After Amazon Redshift provisions a
new cluster according to your resize requirements, there will be a temporary
outage while the old cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the
new cluster. When the new connection is complete, the original access
permissions for the cluster are restored. You can use  describe\-resize to
track the progress of the resize request.
.sp
Valid Values: Integer greater than \fB0\fP .
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cluster\-version\fP  (string)
The new version number of the Amazon Redshift engine to upgrade to.
.sp
For major version upgrades, if a non\-default cluster parameter group is
currently in use, a new cluster parameter group in the cluster parameter group
family for the new version must be specified. The new cluster parameter group
can be the default for that cluster parameter group family.
