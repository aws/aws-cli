**To create or update a logical delivery source**

The following ``put-delivery-source`` example creates a logical delivery source named ``demo-delivery-source``. ::

    aws logs put-delivery-source \
        --name demo-delivery-source \
        --resource-arn arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:123456789012:customization/ABC1DE2FGHI \
        --log-type EVENT_LOGS

Output::

    {
        "deliverySource": {
            "name": "demo-delivery-source",
            "arn": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:delivery-source:demo-delivery-source",
            "resourceArns": [
                "arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:123456789012:customization/ABC1DE2FGHI"
            ],
            "service": "codewhisperer",
            "logType": "EVENT_LOGS"
        }
    }
