describe-subnets
****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your subnets. You can filter the results
to return information only about subnets that match criteria you
specify.

For example, you could ask to get information about a particular
subnet (or all) only if the subnet's state is available. You can
specify multiple filters (e.g., the subnet is in a particular VPC, and
the subnet's state is available).

The result includes information for a particular subnet only if the
subnet matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special
message is returned; the response is simply empty. The following table
shows the available filters.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-subnets
     [--subnet-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--subnet-ids"  (list of string)
   A set of one or more subnet IDs.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Subnets. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]


FILTERS
=======

"availability-zone"
   The Availability Zone for the subnet.

"available-ip-address-count"
   The number of IP addresses in the subnet that are available.

"cidr"
   The CIDR block of the subnet. The CIDR block you specify must
   exactly match the subnet's CIDR block for information to be
   returned for the subnet.

"state"
   The state of the subnet. Valid Values: "pending|available"

"subnet-id"
   The ID of the subnet.

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"vpc-id"
   The ID of the VPC for the subnet.
