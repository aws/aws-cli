.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The get\-federation\-token action returns a set of temporary credentials for a
federated user with the user name and policy specified in the request. The
credentials consist of an Access Key ID, a Secret Access Key, and a security
token. Credentials created by IAM users are valid for the specified duration,
between 15 minutes and 36 hours; credentials created using account credentials
have a maximum duration of one hour.
.sp
The federated user who holds these credentials has any permissions allowed by
the intersection of the specified policy and any resource or user policies that
apply to the caller of the get\-federation\-token API, and any resource policies
that apply to the federated user\(aqs Amazon Resource \-\-name (ARN). For more
information about how token permissions work, see \fI\%Controlling Permissions in
Temporary Credentials\fP
in \fIUsing IAM\fP . For information about using get\-federation\-token to create
temporary credentials, see \fI\%Creating Temporary Credentials to Enable Access for
Federated Users\fP in \fIUsing IAM\fP .

.TP
.B \fB\-\-name\fP  (string)

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-policy\fP  (string)
A policy specifying the permissions to associate with the credentials. The
caller can delegate their own permissions by specifying a policy, and both
policies will be checked when a service call is made. For more information
about how permissions work in the context of temporary credentials, see
\fI\%Controlling Permissions in Temporary Credentials\fP in \fIUsing IAM\fP .
.TP
.B \fB\-\-duration\-seconds\fP  (integer)
The duration, in seconds, that the session should last. Acceptable durations
for federation sessions range from 900s (15 minutes) to 129600s (36 hours),
with 43200s (12 hours) as the default. Sessions for AWS account owners are
restricted to a maximum of 3600s (one hour). If the duration is longer than
one hour, the session for AWS account owners defaults to one hour.
