delete-gateway
**************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation deletes a gateway. To specify which gateway to delete,
use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request. The
operation deletes the gateway; however, it does not delete the gateway
virtual machine (VM) from your host computer.

After you delete a gateway, you cannot reactivate it. Completed
snapshots of the gateway volumes are not deleted upon deleting the
gateway, however, pending snapshots will not complete. After you
delete a gateway, your next step is to remove it from your
environment.

Warning: You no longer pay software charges after the gateway is deleted;
  however, your existing Amazon EBS snapshots persist and you will
  continue to be billed for these snapshots. You can choose to remove
  all remaining Amazon EBS snapshots by canceling your Amazon EC2
  subscription. If you prefer not to cancel your Amazon EC2
  subscription, you can delete your snapshots using the Amazon EC2
  console. For more information, see the AWS Storage Gateway Detail
  Page .
