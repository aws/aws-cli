ruamel.yaml
===========

``ruamel.yaml`` is a YAML 1.2 loader/dumper package for Python.

:version:       0.17.21
:updated:       2022-02-12
:documentation: http://yaml.readthedocs.io
:repository:    https://sourceforge.net/projects/ruamel-yaml/
:pypi:          https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/

*The 0.16.13 release was the last that was tested to be working on Python 2.7.
The 0.17.21 is the last one tested to be working on Python 3.5, 
that is also the last release supporting old PyYAML functions, you'll have to create a 
`YAML()` instance and use its `.load()` and `.dump()` methods.*

*Please adjust your dependencies accordingly if necessary. (`ruamel.yaml<0.18`)*

Starting with version 0.15.0 the way YAML files are loaded and dumped
has been changing, see the API doc for details.  Currently existing
functionality will throw a warning before being changed/removed.
**For production systems already using a pre 0.16 version, you should
pin the version being used with ``ruamel.yaml<=0.15``** if you cannot
fully test upgrading to a newer version. For new usage
pin to the minor version tested ( ``ruamel.yaml<=0.17``) or even to the
exact version used. 

New functionality is usually only available via the new API, so
make sure you use it and stop using the `ruamel.yaml.safe_load()`,
`ruamel.yaml.round_trip_load()` and `ruamel.yaml.load()` functions
(and their `....dump()` counterparts).

If your package uses ``ruamel.yaml`` and is not listed on PyPI, drop
me an email, preferably with some information on how you use the
package (or a link to the repository) and I'll keep you informed
when the status of the API is stable enough to make the transition.

0.17.0 (2021-03-26):
  - removed because of incomplete classifiers
  - this release no longer supports Python 2.7, most if not all Python 2
    specific code is removed. The 0.17.x series is the last to  support Python 3.5
    (this also allowed for removal of the dependency  on ``ruamel.std.pathlib``)
  - remove Python2 specific code branches and adaptations (u-strings)
  - prepare % code for f-strings using ``_F``
  - allow PyOxidisation (`issue 324 <https://sourceforge.net/p/ruamel-yaml/tickets/324/>`__
    resp. `issue 171 <https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/171>`__)
  - replaced Python 2 compatible enforcement of keyword arguments with '*'

    multi-document streams, now issue a ``PendingDeprecationning`` (e.g. when run
    from pytest, but also Python is started with ``-Wd``). Use the methods on
    ``YAML()``, which have been extended.
  - fix for issue 376: indentation changes could put literal/folded scalar to start
    before the ``#`` column of a following comment. Effectively making the comment
    part of the scalar in the output. (reported by
    `Bence Nagy <https://sourceforge.net/u/underyx/>`__)


0.16.13 (2021-03-05):

  - fix for issue 373: recursive call to walk_tree not preserving all params
    (reported by `eulores <https://sourceforge.net/u/eulores/>`__)
  - a None value in a flow-style sequence is now dumped as `null` instead
    of `!!null ''` (reported by mcarans on
