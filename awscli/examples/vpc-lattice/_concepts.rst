This section explains the core concepts and components of Amazon VPC Lattice, along with common usage patterns and examples.

Core Concepts
++++++++++++

Amazon VPC Lattice is an application networking service that lets you connect, secure, and monitor all your services across multiple VPCs and AWS accounts. Here are the key concepts:

Service Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A service network is a logical boundary for a group of services. It acts as a container where you can:

* Connect multiple VPCs
* Define shared security policies
* Monitor service-to-service communication
* Implement consistent access controls

Services
~~~~~~~~
A service represents an application that you want to make available to other applications. Services:

* Can be accessed via DNS names
* Support HTTP/HTTPS traffic
* Can have multiple listeners
* Can route traffic to different target groups

Target Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Target groups define where your service traffic should be directed. They can be:

* Instance-based (EC2 instances)
* IP-based (IP addresses)
* Lambda functions
* Application Load Balancers (ALB)

Components and Their Relationships
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Service Network Association
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two types of associations:

1. Service Association: Links a service to a service network
2. VPC Association: Links a VPC to a service network

This creates the networking fabric that allows services to communicate.

Listeners and Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Listeners define how your service accepts traffic:

* Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Port number
* Rules for routing traffic
* Optional authentication policies

Authentication and Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VPC Lattice supports multiple authentication methods:

* None (open access)
* IAM authentication
* Custom authentication via Lambda

End-to-End Example
+++++++++++++++++

Here's a complete example of setting up a service network with two services:

1. Create a service network::

    aws vpc-lattice create-service-network \
        --name my-service-network

2. Create two services::

    aws vpc-lattice create-service \
        --name service-a \
        --auth-type NONE

    aws vpc-lattice create-service \
        --name service-b \
        --auth-type AWS_IAM

3. Create target groups for each service::

    aws vpc-lattice create-target-group \
        --name service-a-tg \
        --type INSTANCE \
        --config file://tg-config.json

Contents of ``tg-config.json``::

    {
        "port": 80,
        "protocol": "HTTP",
        "protocolVersion": "HTTP1",
        "vpcIdentifier": "vpc-1234567890abcdef0"
    }

4. Create listeners for the services::

    aws vpc-lattice create-listener \
        --service-identifier service-a \
        --name http-listener \
        --protocol HTTP \
        --port 80 \
        --default-action file://default-action.json

Contents of ``default-action.json``::

    {
        "forward": {
            "targetGroups": [
                {
                    "targetGroupIdentifier": "service-a-tg",
                    "weight": 100
                }
            ]
        }
    }

5. Associate services with the service network::

    aws vpc-lattice create-service-network-service-association \
        --service-network-identifier my-service-network \
        --service-identifier service-a

6. Associate VPCs with the service network::

    aws vpc-lattice create-service-network-vpc-association \
        --service-network-identifier my-service-network \
        --vpc-identifier vpc-1234567890abcdef0

Best Practices
+++++++++++++

Security
~~~~~~~~
* Use IAM authentication when possible
* Implement least-privilege access policies
* Use HTTPS listeners for sensitive traffic
* Regularly audit service network associations
* Rotate security credentials regularly
* Use AWS Organizations SCPs to control VPC Lattice permissions
* Implement network ACLs and security groups for additional protection

Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~
* Enable access logs for auditing
* Set up CloudWatch metrics for monitoring
* Use AWS X-Ray for tracing requests
* Monitor target group health status
* Configure CloudWatch alarms for key metrics:
    * TargetGroupHealthyCount
    * RequestCount
    * HTTP 4xx/5xx errors
* Use AWS CloudTrail for API activity monitoring

Scalability
~~~~~~~~~~
* Use multiple target groups for high availability
* Implement health checks for automatic failover
* Configure appropriate timeouts and retries
* Use weighted target groups for traffic distribution
* Consider the following limits:
    * Services per service network
    * Target groups per service
    * Rules per listener
* Implement circuit breakers for downstream service protection

Performance Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Use connection pooling when possible
* Configure appropriate keep-alive settings
* Implement request timeouts based on service SLAs
* Use caching where appropriate
* Monitor and tune target group settings:
    * Health check intervals
    * Deregistration delay
    * Slow start duration

Troubleshooting Guide

Common Issues and Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Service Discovery Issues
-------------------------
If services cannot discover each other:

* Verify DNS resolution is working::

    aws vpc-lattice get-service \
        --service-identifier service-a \
        --query 'dnsEntry'

* Check VPC DNS settings::

    aws ec2 describe-vpc-attribute \
        --vpc-id vpc-1234567890abcdef0 \
        --attribute enableDnsSupport

* Ensure service network associations are active::

    aws vpc-lattice list-service-network-service-associations \
        --service-network-identifier my-service-network \
        --status ACTIVE

2. Authentication Failures
------------------------
For IAM authentication issues:

* Verify IAM policy attachments
* Check for correct principal configuration
* Ensure clock synchronization for signature verification
* Review CloudWatch logs for specific authentication errors

3. Health Check Failures
----------------------
If targets are being marked unhealthy:

* Verify target health status::

    aws vpc-lattice get-target-group-health \
        --target-group-identifier tg-1234567890abcdef0

* Common causes:
    * Security group rules blocking health check traffic
    * Application not responding on configured port
    * Incorrect health check path configuration
    * Target instance/container not running

4. Performance Issues
-------------------
For latency or timeout problems:

* Check target group metrics::

    aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
        --namespace AWS/VpcLattice \
        --metric-name TargetResponseTime \
        --dimensions Name=TargetGroupId,Value=tg-1234567890abcdef0

* Review and adjust:
    * Connection timeouts
    * Request timeouts
    * Health check intervals
    * Target group attributes

Diagnostic Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Check Service Status::

    aws vpc-lattice get-service \
        --service-identifier service-a \
        --query 'status'

2. List Active Listeners::

    aws vpc-lattice list-listeners \
        --service-identifier service-a \
        --status ACTIVE

3. Verify Target Group Configuration::

    aws vpc-lattice get-target-group \
        --target-group-identifier tg-1234567890abcdef0

4. Review Access Logs::

    aws logs get-log-events \
        --log-group-name /aws/vpc-lattice/my-service-network \
        --log-stream-name access-logs
