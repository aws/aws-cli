.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Returns a list of closed workflow executions in the specified \-\-domain that meet
the filtering criteria. The results may be split into multiple pages. To
retrieve subsequent pages, make the call again using the \-\-next\-page\-token
returned by the initial call.
.IP Note
This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may
not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

\fBAccess Control\fP
.sp
You can use IAM policies to control this action\(aqs access to Amazon SWF resources
as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use a \fBResource\fP element with the \-\-domain name to limit the action to only
specified domains.
.IP \(bu 2
Use an \fBAction\fP element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
.IP \(bu 2
Constrain the following parameters by using a \fBCondition\fP element with the
appropriate keys.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtag\fP : String constraint. The key is \fBswf:tagFilter.tag\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtypeFilter.name\fP : String constraint. String constraint. The key is
\fBswf:typeFilter.name\fP .
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtypeFilter.version\fP : String constraint. String constraint. The key is
\fBswf:typeFilter.version\fP .
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the
parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails by
throwing \fBOperationNotPermitted\fP . For details and example IAM policies, see
\fI\%Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows\fP

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-domain\fP  (string)
The name of the \-\-domain that contains the workflow executions to list.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-next\-page\-token\fP  (string)
If on a previous call to this method a \fBNextPageToken\fP was returned, the
results are being paginated. To get the next page of results, repeat the call
with the returned token and all other arguments unchanged.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-maximum\-page\-size\fP  (integer)
The maximum number of results returned in each page. The default is 100, but
the caller can override this value to a page size \fIsmaller\fP than the default.
You cannot specify a page size greater than 100. Note that the number of
executions may be less than the maxiumum page size, in which case, the
returned page will have fewer results than the \-\-maximum\-page\-size specified.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-type\-filter\fP  (structure)
If specified, only executions of the type specified in the filter are
returned.
.IP Note
\fB\-\-close\-status\-filter\fP , \fB\-\-execution\-filter\fP , \fB\-\-type\-filter\fP and
\fB\-\-tag\-filter\fP are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of
these in a request.

.B \fB\-\-execution\-filter\fP  (structure)
If specified, only workflow executions matching the workflow id specified in
the filter are returned.
.IP Note
\fB\-\-close\-status\-filter\fP , \fB\-\-execution\-filter\fP , \fB\-\-type\-filter\fP and
\fB\-\-tag\-filter\fP are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of

.TP
.B \fB\-\-close\-time\-filter\fP  (structure)
If specified, the workflow executions are included in the returned results
based on whether their close times are within the range specified by this
filter. Also, if this parameter is specified, the returned results are ordered
by their close times.
.IP Note
\fB\-\-start\-time\-filter\fP and \fB\-\-close\-time\-filter\fP are mutually exclusive.
You must specify one of these in a request but not both.

.B \fB\-\-reverse\-order\fP  (boolean)
When set to \fBtrue\fP , returns the results in reverse order. By default the
results are returned in descending order of the start or the close time of the
executions.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-close\-status\-filter\fP  (structure)
If specified, only workflow executions that match this \fIclose status\fP are
listed. For example, if TERMINATED is specified, then only TERMINATED workflow
executions are listed.
