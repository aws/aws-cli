"""Generate apache rewrite rules for cross linking.

Example:

^/goto/cli2/acm-2015-12-08/AddTagsToCertificate$

will redirect to the relative path

/cli/latest/reference/acm/add-tags-to-certificate.html

Usage
=====

Make sure you're in a venv with the correct versions of the AWS CLI v2 installed. 
It will be imported directly to generate the crosslinks.

This is a Sphinx extension that gets run after all document updates have been 
executed and before the cleanup phase.
