    """Verify no command params are shadowed or prefixed by the built in param.

    The CLI parses all command line options into a single namespace.
    This means that option names must be unique and cannot conflict
    with the top level params.

    For example, there's a top level param ``--version``.  If an
    operation for a service also provides a ``--version`` option,
    it can never be called because we'll assume the user meant
    the top level ``--version`` param.

    Beyond just direct shadowing, a param which prefixes a builtin
    is also effectively shadowed because argparse will expand
    prefixes of arguments. So `--end` would expand to `--endpoint-url`
    for instance.

    In order to ensure this doesn't happen, this test will go
    through every command table and ensure we're not shadowing
    any builtins.

    Also, rather than being a test generator, we're going to just
    aggregate all the failures in one pass and surface them as
    a single test failure.
