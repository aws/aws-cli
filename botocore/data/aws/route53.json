If MakeChange calls are taking place concurrently, the result of each\n  one will either be completely visible in your results or not at all. You will\n  not see partial changes, or changes that do not ultimately succeed. (This\n  follows from the fact that MakeChange is atomic)\n  </p>\n  <p>The results from ListResourceRecordSets are strongly consistent with\n  ChangeResourceRecordSets. To be precise, if a single process makes a call to\n  ChangeResourceRecordSets and receives a successful response, the effects of that\n  change will be visible in a subsequent call to ListResourceRecordSets by\n  that process.</p>\n  "
