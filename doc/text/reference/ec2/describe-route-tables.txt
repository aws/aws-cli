describe-route-tables
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your route tables. You can filter the
results to return information only about tables that match criteria
you specify. For example, you could get information only about a table
associated with a particular subnet. You can specify multiple values
for the filter. The table must match at least one of the specified
values for it to be included in the results.

You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the table has a particular
route, and is associated with a particular subnet). The result
includes information for a particular table only if it matches all
your filters. If there's no match, no special message is returned; the
response is simply empty.

You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches zero
or more characters, and "?" matches exactly one character. You can
escape special characters using a backslash before the character. For
example, a value of "\*amazon\?\\" searches for the literal string
"*amazon?\" .

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Route Tables. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,

         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .
