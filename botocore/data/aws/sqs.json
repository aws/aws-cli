  "documentation": "\n    <p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable,\n      hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using\n      Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed components of\n      their applications that perform different tasks, without losing messages or\n      requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to\n      build an automated workflow, working in close conjunction with the Amazon\n      Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web\n      services.</p>\n\n    <p>Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale messaging infrastructure as\n      a web service. Any computer on the Internet can add or read messages without\n      any installed software or special firewall configurations. Components of\n      applications using Amazon SQS can run independently, and do not need to be on\n      the same network, developed with the same technologies, or running at the same\n      time.</p>\n\n    <p>Visit <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/</a>\n      for more information.</p>\n  ",

This means you can't extend\n      the timeout of a message in an existing queue to more than a total visibility\n      timeout of 12 hours. (For more information visibility timeout, see <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html\">Visibility\n        Timeout</a> in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.)</p>\n\n    <p>For example, let's say you have a message and its default message visibility\n      timeout is 30 minutes. You could call <code>ChangeMessageVisiblity</code> with\n      a value of two hours and the effective timeout would be two hours and 30\n      minutes. When that time comes near you could again extend the time out by\n      calling ChangeMessageVisiblity, but this time the maximum allowed timeout would\n      be 9 hours and 30 minutes.</p>\n\n    <important>If you attempt to set the <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> to an\n      amount more than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will\n      not automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum time\n      remaining.</important>\n\n    <important>Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a\n      specific message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is not saved in\n      memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received,\n      the visibility timeout for the message the next time it is received reverts to\n      the original timeout value, not the value you set with the\n      ChangeMessageVisibility action.</important>\n  "
