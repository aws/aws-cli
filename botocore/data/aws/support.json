This service enables you to manage with your AWS Support cases programmatically. It is built on the AWS Query API programming model and provides HTTP methods that take parameters and return results in JSON format.</p>\n    \n    <p>The AWS Support service also exposes a set of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/support/trustedadvisor\" title=\"TrustedAdvisor\">Trusted Advisor</a> features. You can retrieve a list of checks you can run on your resources, specify checks to run and refresh, and check the status of checks you have submitted. </p> \n    \n    <p>The following list describes the AWS Support case management actions: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n<b>Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels. </b>The actions <a href=\"API_DescribeServices.html\" title=\"DescribeServices\">DescribeServices</a> and <a href=\"API_DescribeSeverityLevels.html\">DescribeSeverityLevels</a> enable you to obtain AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels.
