Welcome to botocore
===================

Botocore is a low-level interface to a growing number of Amazon Web
Services.  Botocore serves as the foundation for the
`AWS-CLI <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/>`_ command line utilities.
It will also play an important role in the boto3.x project.

The botocore package is compatible with Python versions 2.6.x - 3.3.x.
