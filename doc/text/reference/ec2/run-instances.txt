run-instances
*************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The run-instances operation launches a specified number of instances.

If Amazon EC2 cannot launch the minimum number AMIs you request, no
instances launch. If there is insufficient capacity to launch the
maximum number of AMIs you request, Amazon EC2 launches as many as
possible to satisfy the requested maximum values.

Every instance is launched in a security group. If you do not specify
a security group at launch, the instances start in your default
security group. For more information on creating security groups, see
CreateSecurityGroup.

An optional instance type can be specified. For information about
instance types, see Instance Types.

You can provide an optional key pair ID for each image in the launch
request (for more information, see CreateKeyPair). All instances that
are created from images that use this key pair will have access to the
associated public key at boot. You can use this key to provide secure
access to an instance of an image on a per-instance basis. Amazon EC2
public images use this feature to provide secure access without
passwords.

Warning: Launching public images without a key pair ID will leave them
  inaccessible.The public key material is made available to the
  instance at boot time by placing it in the "openssh_id.pub" file on
  a logical device that is exposed to the instance as "/dev/sda2" (the
  ephemeral store). The format of this file is suitable for use as an
  entry within "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" (the OpenSSH format). This can
  be done at boot (e.g., as part of "rc.local" ) allowing for secure
  access without passwords.Optional user data can be provided in the
  launch request. All instances that collectively comprise the launch
  request have access to this data For more information, see Instance
  Metadata.

Note: If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user
  has not subscribed, the run-instances call will fail.

Warning: We strongly recommend using the 2.6.18 Xen stock kernel with the
  "c1.medium" and "c1.xlarge" instances. Although the default Amazon
  EC2 kernels will work, the new kernels provide greater stability and
  performance for these instance types. For more information about
  kernels, see Kernels, RAM Disks, and Block Device Mappings.

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--min-count"  (integer)
   Minimum number of instances to launch. If the value is more than
   Amazon EC2 can launch, no instances are launched at all.

"--image-id"  (string)
   Unique ID of a machine image, returned by a call to DescribeImages.

"--max-count"  (integer)
   Maximum number of instances to launch. If the value is more than
   Amazon EC2 can launch, the largest possible number above minCount
   will be launched instead.

   Between 1 and the maximum number allowed for your account (default:
   20).

"--ramdisk-id"  (string)
   The ID of the RAM disk with which to launch the instance. Some
