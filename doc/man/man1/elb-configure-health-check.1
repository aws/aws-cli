.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Enables the client to define an application healthcheck for the instances.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws elb configure\-health\-check
  \-\-health\-check <value>
  \-\-load\-balancer\-name <value>
.ft P
.fi
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-health\-check\fP  (structure)
A structure containing the configuration information for the new healthcheck.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBhealthy_threshold\fP  (integer)
Specifies the number of consecutive health probe successes required before
moving the instance to the \fIHealthy\fP state.
.TP
.B \fBinterval\fP  (integer)
Specifies the approximate interval, in seconds, between health checks of an
individual instance.
.TP
.B \fBtarget\fP  (string)
Specifies the instance being checked. The protocol is either TCP, HTTP,
HTTPS, or SSL. The range of valid ports is one (1) through 65535.
.IP Note
TCP is the default, specified as a TCP: port pair, for example "\fI\%TCP:5000\fP".
In this case a healthcheck simply attempts to open a TCP connection to the
instance on the specified port. Failure to connect within the configured
timeout is considered unhealthy.
.sp
SSL is also specified as SSL: port pair, for example, SSL:5000.
.sp
For HTTP or HTTPS protocol, the situation is different. You have to
include a ping path in the string. HTTP is specified as a
\fI\%HTTP:port;/;PathToPing\fP; grouping, for example
"\fI\%HTTP:80/weather/us/wa/seattle\fP". In this case, a HTTP GET request is
issued to the instance on the given port and path. Any answer other than
"200 OK" within the timeout period is considered unhealthy.
.sp
The total length of the HTTP ping target needs to be 1024 16\-bit Unicode
characters or less.
.RE
.TP
.B \fBtimeout\fP  (integer)
Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a
failed health probe.
.IP Note
This value must be less than the \fIInterval\fP value.
.RE
.TP
.B \fBunhealthy_threshold\fP  (integer)
Specifies the number of consecutive health probe failures required before
moving the instance to the \fIUnhealthy\fP state.
