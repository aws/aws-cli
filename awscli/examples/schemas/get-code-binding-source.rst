**To retrieve the code binding source URI from an existing schema version for a particular language and exports the content to an outfile**

You may specify languages such as Java8, TypeScript3, Python36, and Go1. If successful, your code binding source URI will be available in your local machine. ::

    aws schemas get-code-binding-source \
        --registry-name example-registry \ 
        --schema-name example-schema \
        --language Python36 <outfile>.zip
