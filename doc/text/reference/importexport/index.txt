AWS Import/Export
*****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

AWS Import/Export accelerates transferring large amounts of data
between the AWS cloud and portable storage devices that you mail to
us. AWS Import/Export transfers data directly onto and off of your
storage devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network and
bypassing the Internet. For large data sets, AWS Import/Export is
often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than
upgrading your connectivity.
