describe-vpn-gateways
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your VPN gateways. You can filter the
results to return information only about VPN gateways that match
criteria you specify.

For example, you could ask to get information about a particular VPN
gateway (or all) only if the gateway's state is pending or available.
You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the VPN gateway is in a
particular Availability Zone and the gateway's state is pending or
available).

The result includes information for a particular VPN gateway only if
the gateway matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special
message is returned; the response is simply empty. The following table
shows the available filters.

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple

         operation.

         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

            Contains one or more values for the filter.
