terminate-job-flows
*******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

terminate-job-flows shuts a list of job flows down. When a job flow is
shut down, any step not yet completed is canceled and the EC2
instances on which the job flow is running are stopped. Any log files
not already saved are uploaded to Amazon S3 if a LogUri was specified
when the job flow was created.

The call to terminate-job-flows is asynchronous. Depending on the
configuration of the job flow, it may take up to 5-20 minutes for the
job flow to completely terminate and release allocated resources, such
as Amazon EC2 instances.
