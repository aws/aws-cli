query-objects
*************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Queries a pipeline for the names of objects that match a specified set
of conditions.

The objects returned by QueryResults are paginated and then filtered
by the value you set for query. This means the action may return an
empty result set with a value set for marker. If "HasMoreResults" is
set to "True" , you should continue to call QueryObjects, passing in
the returned value for marker, until "HasMoreResults" returns "False"
.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws datapipeline query-objects
     --pipeline-id <value>
     --sphere <value>
     [--marker <value>]
     [--query <value>]
     [--limit <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--pipeline-id"  (string)
   Identifier of the pipeline to be queried for object names.

"--sphere"  (string)
   Specifies whether the --query applies to components or instances.
   Allowable values: COMPONENT, INSTANCE, ATTEMPT.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--marker"  (string)
   The starting point for the results to be returned. The first time
   you call QueryObjects, this value should be empty. As long as the
   action returns "HasMoreResults" as "True" , you can call query-
   objects again and pass the --marker value from the response to
   retrieve the next set of results.

"--query"  (structure)
   Query that defines the objects to be returned. The Query object can
   contain a maximum of ten selectors. The conditions in the --query
   are limited to top-level String fields in the object. These filters
   can be applied to components, instances, and attempts.

   "selectors"  (list)
      List of selectors that define the query. An object must satisfy
      all of the selectors to match the query.

         (structure)
            A comparision that is used to determine whether a --query
            should return this object.

            "operator"  (structure)
               "values"  (list of string)
                  The value that the actual field value will be
                  compared with.

               "type"  (string)
                  The logical operation to be performed: equal (EQ),
                  equal reference (REF_EQ), less than or equal (LE),
                  greater than or equal (GE), or between (BETWEEN).
                  Equal reference (REF_EQ) can be used only with
                  reference fields. The other comparison types can be
                  used only with String fields. The comparison types
                  you can use apply only to certain object fields, as
                  detailed below.

                  The comparison operators EQ and REF_EQ act on the
                  following fields:

                  * name

                  * @sphere

                  * parent

                  * @componentParent

                  * @instanceParent

                  * @status

                  * @scheduledStartTime

                  * @scheduledEndTime

                  * @actualStartTime

                  * @actualEndTime

                  The comparison operators GE, LE, and BETWEEN act on
                  the following fields:

                  * @scheduledStartTime

                  * @scheduledEndTime

                  * @actualStartTime

                  * @actualEndTime

                  Note that fields beginning with the at sign (@) are
                  read-only and set by the web service. When you name
                  fields, you should choose names containing only
                  alpha-numeric values, as symbols may be reserved by
                  AWS Data Pipeline. A best practice for user-defined
                  fields that you add to a pipeline is to prefix their
                  name with the string "my".

            "field_name"  (string)
               The name of the field that the operator will be applied
               to. The field name is the "key" portion of the field
               definition in the pipeline definition syntax that is
               used by the AWS Data Pipeline API. If the field is not
               set on the object, the condition fails.

   *Parameter Syntax*

              },
            "field_name": "string"

              },
            "field_name": "string"
          }
          ...
        ]
      }

"--limit"  (integer)
   Specifies the maximum number of object names that query-objects
   will return in a single call. The default value is 100.
