*************


DESCRIPTION
===========

To create a preset, send a POST request to the "/2012-09-25/presets"
resource.

Warning: Elastic Transcoder checks the settings that you specify to ensure
  that they meet Elastic Transcoder requirements and to determine
  whether they comply with H.264 standards. If your settings are not
  valid for Elastic Transcoder, Elastic Transcoder returns an HTTP 400
  response ( "ValidationException" ) and does not create the preset.
  If the settings are valid for Elastic Transcoder but aren't strictly
  compliant with the H.264 standard, Elastic Transcoder creates the
  preset and returns a warning message in the response. This helps you
  determine whether your settings comply with the H.264 standard while
  giving you greater flexibility with respect to the video that
  Elastic Transcoder produces.

Elastic Transcoder uses the H.264 video-compression format. For more
information, see the International Telecommunication Union publication
*Recommendation ITU-T H.264: Advanced video coding for generic
audiovisual services* .


SYNOPSIS

   aws elastictranscoder create-preset
     --container <value>
     --thumbnails <value>
     --video <value>
     --audio <value>
     --name <value>
     [--description <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--container"  (string)
   The container type for the output file. This value must be "mp4" .

"--thumbnails"  (structure)
   A section of the request body that specifies the thumbnail
   parameters, if any.

   "aspect_ratio"  (string)
      The aspect ratio of thumbnails. Valid values include:

      "auto" , "1:1" , "4:3" , "3:2" , "16:9"

      If you specify "auto" , Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve the
      aspect ratio of the video in the output file.

   "interval"  (string)
      The number of seconds between thumbnails. Specify an integer
      value.

   "resolution"  (string)
      The width and height of thumbnail files in pixels. Specify a
      value in the format "*width* `` x ``*height* `` where both
      values are even integers. The values cannot exceed the width and
      height that you specified in the ``Video:Resolution" object.

   "format"  (string)
      The format of thumbnails, if any. Valid values are "jpg" and
      "png" .

      You specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder to create
      thumbnails when you create a job.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "aspect_ratio": "string",
        "interval": "string",
        "resolution": "string",
        "format": "string"
      }

"--video"  (structure)
   A section of the request body that specifies the video parameters.

   "resolution"  (string)
      The width and height of the video in the output file, in pixels.
      Valid values are "auto" and *width* x *height* :

      * "auto" : Elastic Transcoder attempts to preserve the width and
        height of the input file, subject to the following rules.

      * >>``<<*width* x *height* `` : The width and height of the
        output video in pixels.

      Note the following about specifying the width and height:

      * The width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096,
        inclusive.

      * The height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072,
        inclusive.

      * If you specify a resolution that is less than the resolution
        of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output file
        to the lower resolution.

      * If you specify a resolution that is greater than the
        resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the
        output to the higher resolution.

      * We recommend that you specify a resolution for which the
        product of width and height is less than or equal to the
        applicable value in the following list (*List - Max width x
        height value* ):

      * 1 - 25344

      * 1b - 25344

      * 1.1 - 101376

      * 1.2 - 101376

      * 1.3 - 101376

      * 2 - 101376

      * 2.1 - 202752

      * 2.2 - 404720

      * 3 - 404720

      * 3.1 - 921600

      * 3.2 - 1310720

      * 4 - 2097152

      * 4.1 - 2097152

   "frame_rate"  (string)
      The frames per second for the video stream in the output file.
      Valid values include:

      "auto" , "10" , "15" , "23.97" , "24" , "25" , "29.97" , "30" ,
      "60"

      If you specify "auto" , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected
      frame rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate, we
      recommend that you perform the following calculation:

      "Frame rate = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma
      samples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)"

      where:

      * *width in pixels* and *height in pixels* represent the
        Resolution of the output video.

      * *maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second* is
        less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the
        following table, based on the value that you specified for
        Level.

      The maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second
      for each level is described in the following list (*Level -
      Decoding speed* ):

      * 1 - 380160

      * 1b - 380160

      * 1.1 - 76800

      * 1.2 - 1536000

      * 1.3 - 3041280

      * 2 - 3041280

      * 2.1 - 5068800

      * 2.2 - 5184000

      * 3 - 10368000

      * 3.1 - 27648000

      * 3.2 - 55296000

      * 4 - 62914560

      * 4.1 - 62914560

   "keyframes_max_dist"  (string)
      The maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are
      fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded
      based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The value is
      an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 and
      100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher compression
      but may also discernibly decrease video quality.

   "fixed_gop"  (string)
      Whether to use a fixed value for "FixedGOP" . Valid values are
      "true" and "false" :

      * "true" : Elastic Transcoder uses the value of
        "KeyframesMaxDist" for the distance between key frames (the
        number of frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).

      * "false" : The distance between key frames can vary.

   "codec"  (string)
      The video codec for the output file. This value must be "H.264"
      .

   "codec_options"  (map)
      **Profile**

      The H.264 profile that you want to use for the output file.
      Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:

      * "baseline" : The profile most commonly used for
        videoconferencing and for mobile applications.

      * "main" : The profile used for standard-definition digital TV
        broadcasts.

      * "high" : The profile used for high-definition digital TV
        broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.

      **Level**

      The H.264 level that you want to use for the output file.
      Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:

      "1" , "1b" , "1.1" , "1.2" , "1.3" , "2" , "2.1" , "2.2" , "3" ,
      "3.1" , "3.2" , "4" , "4.1"

      **MaxReferenceFrames**

      The maximum number of previously decoded frames to use as a
      reference for decoding future frames. Valid values are integers
      0 through 16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater
      than the following:

      "Min(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 /
      (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)"

      where *Width in pixels* and *Height in pixels* represent the
      resolution of the output video and *Maximum decoded picture
      buffer in macroblocks* depends on the value of the "Level"
      object. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)

      Note that the calculation for maximum decoded picture buffer,
      which is similar to the calculation for maximum reference
      frames, uses macroblocks instead of pixels for the width and
      height of the video.

      To determine the value of maximum decoded picture buffer in
      macroblocks, see the following list (*Level* - *Maximum decoded
      picture buffer* ):

      * 1 - 396

      * 1b - 396

      * 1.1 - 900

      * 1.2 - 2376

      * 1.3 - 2376

      * 2 - 2376

      * 2.1 - 4752

      * 2.2 - 8100

      * 3 - 8100

      * 3.1 - 18000

      * 3.2 - 20480

      * 4 - 32768

      * 4.1 - 32768

   "aspect_ratio"  (string)
      The display aspect ratio of the video in the output file. Valid
      values include:

      "auto" , "1:1" , "4:3" , "3:2" , "16:9"

      If you specify "auto" , Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve the
      aspect ratio of the input file.

      If you specify an aspect ratio for the output file that differs
      from aspect ratio of the input file, Elastic Transcoder adds
      pillarboxing (black bars on the sides) or letterboxing (black
      bars on the top and bottom) to maintain the aspect ratio of the
      active region of the video.

   "bit_rate"  (string)
      The bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in
      kilobits/second. Valid values depend on the values of "Level"
      and "Profile" . We recommend that you specify a value less than
      or equal to the maximum H.264-compliant value listed in the
      following list for your level and profile:

      *Level - Maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (baseline and
      main Profile) : maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (high
      Profile)*

      * 1 - 64 : 80

      * 1b - 128 : 160

      * 1.1 - 192 : 240

      * 1.2 - 384 : 480

      * 1.3 - 768 : 960

      * 2 - 2000 : 2500

      * 3 - 10000 : 12500

      * 3.1 - 14000 : 17500

      * 3.2 - 20000 : 25000

      * 4 - 20000 : 25000

      * 4.1 - 50000 : 62500
