delete-vpn-connection
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deletes a VPN connection. Use this if you want to delete a VPC and all
its associated components. Another reason to use this operation is if
you believe the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection have been
compromised. In that situation, you can delete the VPN connection and
create a new one that has new keys, without needing to delete the VPC
or VPN gateway. If you create a new VPN connection, you must
reconfigure the customer gateway using the new configuration
information returned with the new VPN connection ID.

If you're deleting the VPC and all its associated parts, we recommend
you detach the VPN gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before
deleting the VPN connection.
